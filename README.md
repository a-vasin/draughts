# Draughts
Multiplayer Draughts (aka Checkers) for local network with observer mode

I hope you are familiar with this game so I won't explain rules =)

## Menu
Menu is located to the left of the window and contains following:
* Create game - host a game using password and wait for connections
* Join game - join to a hosted game as a player
* Watch game - join to a hosted game as a spectator
* Restart - returns program to initial state if game is finished or connection was lost
* "Enter password" field - password that will be used as game session ID

Creating/joining/watching game based on matching game session IDs.

## UI
All available actions are highlighted so you won't get confused =) 

(Hint: if nothing is highlighted when game is running - it's not your turn)

If all of a sudden you are still got confused you can track game status in the bottom of the window.
